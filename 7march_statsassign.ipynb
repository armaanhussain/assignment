    "Q6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data? Provide an\n",

    "\n",

    "the level of measurement. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can't calculate a mean for ordinal data. If you have survey responses on a Likert scale (e.g., strongly \n",
    "agree = 5, agree = 4, etc.), taking the average doesn't make sense since the numerical values don't represent \n",
    "equidistant intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, using mean values for nominal data (like the color of cars) doesn't hold significance because there's\n",
    "no inherent order or mathematical operation applicable to colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval and ratio data allow for more advanced statistical analyses like ANOVA, regression, etc., due to their \n",
    "ability to represent equidistant intervals and possess a true zero point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, understanding the level of measurement helps in selecting appropriate statistical tools and avoiding \n",

    "Ans10. Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean represents the average value in a dataset. It's calculated by summing all values and dividing \n",
    "by the number of observations. The mean is sensitive to extreme values and provides a balanced representation \n",
    "of the data.\n",
    "Example: In a set of test scores (80, 85, 90, 60, 95), the mean score would be (80 + 85 + 90 + 60 + 95) / 5 = 82.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when arranged in ascending or descending order. It's less\n",
    "influenced by extreme values and offers insight into the central value.\n",
    "Example: In the same test scores dataset, if arranged in order: 60, 80, 85, 90, 95, the median score is 85.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. It's particularly useful for categorical \n",
    "data but can also be applicable to numerical data.\n",
    "Example: In a set of numbers (3, 5, 5, 7, 9, 9, 9), the mode is 9 as it appears most frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It gives an indication of \n",
    "the spread of values.\n",
    "Example: For the test scores (60, 80, 85, 90, 95), the range would be 95 - 60 = 35.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: Variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean. It quantifies the spread of values around \n",
    "the mean.\n",
    "Example: It involves a formula that computes the squared differences between each value and the mean, then averaging\n",
    "those squared differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation: The standard deviation measures the average distance of values from the mean. It provides a more\n",
    "interpretable measure of variability than variance.\n",
    "Example: For the test scores, after calculating the variance, the standard deviation can be obtained by taking the \n",
    "square root of the variance.\n",
